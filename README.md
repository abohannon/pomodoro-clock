POMODORO CLOCK IN VANILLA JS 

To keep things simple for this challenge I just included everything in a single HTML file.

Things I used/learned:

- More practice with vanilla js and not jQuery
- How to use setInterval
- Event bubbling
- Using parseInt to format numbers appropriately
- Using a flag to prevent user input (i.e. initiating setInterval a second time which would speed up the clock)
- Including audio via new Audio()

Things I need to work on:

- Creating more and cleaner functions and passing them around. I tend to create very large functions which 
ultimately get confusing to read. I did a little bit of this in this project with formatTime() but I think I could
simplify things a lot more.
- Planning out my apps in advance. I had an idea of how I wanted to attack the clock but didn't write anything down.
This made things more confusing a long the way and ultimately resulted in me hacking things together with a lot of trial
and error. I think I could cut down on this by having a clearer idea where I'm going before I start.
